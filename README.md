# MApUCE tools




"MApUCE tools" is an OrbisGIS plugin that contains a set of WPS scripts to process geometries and compute geographical indicators.
"MApUCE tools" was originally developed during [MapUCE Project](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/?Projet=ANR-13-VBDU-0004) (Modeling and urbAn Planning laws: Urban 
Climate and Energy, 2014-2018),  ANR Programme: Villes et BÃ¢timents Durables (VBD) 2013.


The WPS scripts need a connection to remote spatial database that stores a collection of pre-processed vectorial data. This database called MApUCE
is hosted on our own server and only available for the partners of the project.
